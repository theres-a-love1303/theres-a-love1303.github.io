 <h1>The cavern quakes as you step forward, the chest glowing like a dying star. The Entity’s voice fills your mind, honey and venom: “Yes… you were always meant for this.”<br> Your hand meets the obsidian arch. Shadows surge, wrapping your body in armor not of steel, but of living night. The factions scream—priests shrieking in terror, the bandits groveling, the summoner laughing even as his bones shatter.<br>
The Gate bursts open. From its void steps the horned colossus, yet it does not stand above you. It kneels. “Herald,” it whispers, “command me.”<br>
Hollowvale’s lights flicker as night swallows the land. And beyond its borders, across kingdoms yet unseen, people will learn to tremble at your name.</h1>
