 <h1>The summoner raises a wall of shadow, splitting you from half the bandits. On your side, only the wounded leader remains. “Courier… we end him together, or not at all!”
You and the leader fight shoulder to shoulder, cutting into the summoner. But as the summoner collapses, the leader snatches the chest. “Hollowvale pays well for artifacts. My thanks, courier.”</h1>
